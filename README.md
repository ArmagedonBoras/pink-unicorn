The Pink Unicorn is here!

How to set up locally:

* Read https://laravel.com/docs/10.x first page for an overview of options for preferred environment:
  * Local install with lamp/xampp/mamp or similar package
  * Docker, (via Laravel Sail?)
  * WSL2 with a linux distribution of your choice
* Install in your preferred environment:
  * PHP >= 8.1
  * Mysql database
  * Optionally, a web server software like apache2 or nginx
  * Composer (https://getcomposer.org/)
* Clone this repository
* Run Composer update by `composer update`
* Copy example.env to .env
* generate an app key by `php artisan key:generate` 
* edit the .env:
  * Edit the Mysql database connection information:
    * DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    * DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    * DB_PORT=3306
    * DB_DATABASE=
    * DB_USERNAME=
    * DB_PASSWORD=
  * Edit the filemaker connection information:
    * FM_HOST=
    * FM_DATABASE=
    * FM_USERNAME=
    * FM_PASSWORD=
    * FM_PREFIX=
    * FM_VERSION=vLatest

  * If you have a web server software available, set the the hostname you have configured in .env:
    * APP_URL=
* Create tables and seed default data by `php artisan reseed` (custom artisan command)

The database seeder is set up with:
  * a bunch of default pages
  * a few current users (Ã–rjan & Niklas, please add your own if you are not them...)
  * a bunch of default roles
  * a bunch of menu items for what is developed

Laravel is set up with this boilerplate:
  * Jetstream with Livewire
  * Bootstrap 5 with Bootstrap Icons
  * Summernote Rich Text Editor
